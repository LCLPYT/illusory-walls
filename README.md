# Illusory Walls
A Fabric mod for map makers that adds illusory walls to Minecraft.
Once a player attacks an illusory wall, or a projectile impacts on one, the wall will fade.

Illusory walls can be created by operators with a new "Staff of Illusion" item.
The staff can be found in the operator items tab or with this give command: `/give @s illwalls:staff_of_illusion`.
Once you hold the staff, all illusory walls will be displayed with an outline.
Right click to make any block illusory.
Left click a block to remove it from an illusory wall.
